## 📊 Analysis Overview

### ✅ Key Objectives:

- Calculate conversion rates (Transactions / Total Visits) at both Store and SKU levels.
- Identify top- and bottom-performing stores and SKUs.
- Visualize conversion trends.
- Provide actionable recommendations to improve performance.

### 📈 Key Insights:

- Large variation in conversion rates between stores (from ~34% to 66%).
- Some SKUs convert nearly all visits, while others convert none.
- High visits don’t guarantee high conversions — UI/UX and product relevance matter.
  
### 🔧 Tools Used:

- **Python** (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- **Power BI** *(dashboard to be added below)*
